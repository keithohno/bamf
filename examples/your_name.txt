Once in a while when I wake up

I find myself crying.

The dream I must have had I can never recall.

But...

But...

the sensation that I've lost something

lingers for a long time after I wake up.

I'm always searching

for something, for someone.

This feeling has possessed me I think from that clay...

That day when the stars came falling.

It was almost as if...

as if a scene from a dream.

Nothing more, nothing less

than a beautiful view.

Ah, if only our voices speak at night

could ever reach the very edge of this World, and the time

Instead of fading into air and dust

Then what will the words could ever be? Farthest words from probably

Let's make a promise, that will never fade Let's say it together in count of three, oh

Ah, I'm told that some part of every wish will be heard

But lately I lost sight of the truth in those words

I can't even remember when I gave up believing What could have been the reason?

Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop And the place rainbow born and dies

And where the end of this life lies

I've always been insisting there was something that I've longing for

One day we'll reach to emotions unexplored unprecedented

We'll high-five love we've yet to discover and give a kiss to time

The five dimensions keep on teasing me But I will keep on looking at you, dear

Let's make a sign for when we say "nice to meet you" again

I'm on my way to you, chasing after your name
